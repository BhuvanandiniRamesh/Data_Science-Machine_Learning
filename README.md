Sentiment analysis of movie reviews is crucial for understanding audience reactions and preferences. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to predict whether a movie review is positive or negative based on the text content. By analyzing large datasets of movie reviews, we can develop models that provide valuable insights into audience sentiments, aiding filmmakers, producers, and distributors in decision-making processes.

**Summary**

This project involves the development of a sentiment prediction model using machine learning techniques applied to a dataset consisting of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. Here's a breakdown of the project components:

1. **Dataset**: Utilized a dataset containing movie reviews along with their corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative).

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the text data by removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, removing stopwords, and stemming the words.

3. **Feature Extraction**: Employed techniques like CountVectorizer and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.

4. **Model Development**: Utilized various machine learning algorithms such as Neural Networks (specifically, a simple deep learning model using Keras) to train on the processed text data and predict sentiment labels.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the performance of the trained model using accuracy metrics and validation techniques to ensure robustness and reliability.

6. **Prediction**: Applied the trained model to predict sentiment labels for new, unseen movie reviews.

**1. Dataset**: 
   - The dataset used in this project is available in CSV format and contains movie reviews along with their corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative).

**2. Code Files**:
   - `train.csv`: Contains the training data with movie reviews and sentiment labels.
   - `test.csv`: Contains the test data with movie reviews for which sentiment labels need to be predicted.
   - `sentiment_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and prediction.

**3. Python Libraries Used**:
   - `numpy`: For numerical operations and array handling.
   - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
   - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.
   - `re`: For regular expression operations.
   - `nltk`: Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing tasks.
   - `scikit-learn`: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
   - `tensorflow` and `keras`: For building and training neural network models.

**4. Execution**:
   - Ensure all required libraries are installed.
   - Execute the code cells in `sentiment_prediction.ipynb` sequentially to perform data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
   - The trained model predicts sentiment labels for the test data and saves the predictions in a CSV file named `prediction.csv`.

**5. Results**:
   - The trained model achieves a validation accuracy of X% on the test data, indicating its effectiveness in predicting sentiment labels for movie reviews.

**6. Future Improvements**:
   - Experiment with different neural network architectures and hyperparameters to improve model performance.
   - Explore advanced natural language processing techniques such as word embeddings for better feature representation.
   - Incorporate additional features such as metadata (e.g., movie genre, release year) for enhanced prediction accuracy.

**7. Conclusion**:
   - Sentiment analysis of movie reviews provides valuable insights into audience preferences and reactions, aiding filmmakers and distributors in decision-making processes. The developed model demonstrates promising results in predicting sentiment labels for movie reviews, contributing to the field of sentiment analysis in the entertainment industry.
